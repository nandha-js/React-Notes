# ⚛️ What is a Component in React?

A **component** in React is a **reusable piece of code** that defines part of the user interface (UI) — like a button, header, or card.

---

## 🧩 **In short:**
Components are the **building blocks** of a React app.  
They make your UI **modular, reusable, and easy to manage**.

---

## 🧠 **Example:**
```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React Component!</h1>;
}

```
## 💡 Tip:

React has two types of components:

Functional Components – simple and commonly used

Class Components – older style, less common now

Modern React apps mostly use Functional Components with Hooks because they are simpler, faster, and easier to maintain.
