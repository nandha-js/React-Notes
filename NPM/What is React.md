# ⚛️ What is React?

**React** is a **JavaScript library** used to build **user interfaces (UIs)** — especially for **single-page applications (SPAs)**.

---

## 🧩 In short:
React helps developers create **dynamic**, **fast**, and **interactive** web apps using **components** (small reusable UI pieces).

---

## 🧠 Example:
A simple React component 👇  
```jsx
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

```
## 💡 Tip:

React was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by Meta and the open-source community.
It focuses only on the view layer, making it flexible and easy to integrate with other tools.
