# 🧩 Library vs Framework

Understanding the difference between a **library** and a **framework** is important when learning tools like **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue**.

---

## ⚙️ **Library**
- A **library** is a collection of reusable code you can call when needed.  
- **You control the flow** of your application.  
- You decide **when and how** to use the library.

🧠 **Example:**  
React, Lodash, Axios

📘 **In simple words:**  
*You call the library.*

---

## 🏗️ **Framework**
- A **framework** provides a complete structure for your app.  
- **It controls the flow** — you follow its rules and structure.  
- It decides **when and how** your code runs.

🧠 **Example:**  
Angular, Django, Laravel

📘 **In simple words:**  
*The framework calls your code.*

## 💡 **Tip:**
React is a **library**, not a framework — it focuses only on building the **UI**, while you decide the rest (routing, data fetching, etc.).
