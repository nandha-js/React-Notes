# 🌐 What is a Single Page Application (SPA)?

A **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a **web app that loads a single HTML page** and **dynamically updates** the content without reloading the entire page.

---

## 🧩 **In short:**
SPAs make websites **faster and smoother** by updating only parts of the page instead of loading everything again from the server.

---

## ⚙️ **How it Works:**
- The browser loads the page **once**.
- When you navigate, **JavaScript changes the content** dynamically.
- No full page reload happens — only specific data updates.

---

## 🧠 **Example:**
- Gmail  
- Facebook  
- Twitter  
- React, Vue, and Angular apps  

---

## 💡 **Tip:**
React is often used to build **SPAs**, because it updates only what’s needed on the screen — making apps **fast and responsive**.
