# 📦 What is NPM in React?

**NPM (Node Package Manager)** is a tool that helps you **install, manage, and use packages (libraries)** in your React project.

---

## 🧩 In short:
It’s like an *app store for JavaScript* — you use it to add tools and libraries *(like React, Axios, Tailwind, etc.)* to your project.

---

## 🧠 Example:
```bash
npm install react
 
 ```

## 💡 Tip:

NPM comes automatically when you install Node.js.
You can check your npm version using: npm -v
